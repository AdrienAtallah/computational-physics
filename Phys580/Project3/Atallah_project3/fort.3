# 'fort.3' contains the solutions to the coefficients for each order
# polynomial.  the first column corresponds to the 2nd order polynomial, which
# is a 3x1 dimension matrix, so the last 2 values should be ignored.
# The second column is for the 3rd order polynomial, which is a 4x1 dimension
# matrix, so the last value should be ignored.  Finally the last column
# corresponds to the coefficients of the 4th degree polynomial and no
# values need be ignored.
